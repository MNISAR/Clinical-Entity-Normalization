She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant . DISPOSITION : The patient was discharged to home in stable condition . Cultures were pending on her aspirate and will be treated with po doxycycline . Dictated By : JIMCHARL B.

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and [MASK]which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had [MASK]and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema .

Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle .

She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle .

She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant . DISPOSITION : The patient was discharged to home in stable condition . Cultures were pending on her aspirate and will be treated with po doxycycline . Dictated By : JIMCHARL B.

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for [MASK]patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . [MASK]23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 .

Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant . DISPOSITION : The patient was discharged to home in stable condition . Cultures were pending on her aspirate and will be treated with po doxycycline . Dictated By : JIMCHARL B.

She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had [MASK]pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema .

Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant . DISPOSITION : The patient was discharged to home in stable condition . Cultures were pending on her aspirate and will be treated with po doxycycline . Dictated By : JIMCHARL B.

She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant . DISPOSITION : The patient was discharged to home in stable condition . Cultures were pending on her aspirate and will be treated with po doxycycline . Dictated By : JIMCHARL B.

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral [MASK], medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant .

She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint . She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child . She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive . She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission . At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity . She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI . She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month . She has had similar pain intermittently for last year . She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise . She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers . In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver . She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys . Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal . Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then . The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss . She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle . She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . ALLERGIES : BACTRIM . MEDICATIONS : On admission included Percocet , Prinovil , Dapsone , Mycelex troches . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient was recently separated from her husband . She lives with her daughter . She does not drink , use IV drugs or smoke . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission revealed a cachetic woman in no acute distress with stable vital signs . She was afebrile . She was not orthostatic . Blood pressure 110/80 . HEENT exam was within normal limits . Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally . Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur . Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . There was no hepatosplenomegaly . Extremities revealed a 2 x 3 cm tender mass in the lateral left calf , medial 1 cm mass above her knee . There was no evidence of edema . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included BUN / creatinine of 33/2.1 . Sodium 141 . Potassium 4.2 . Hematocrit 23 . White blood cell count was 2.1 with 56 polys and 1 band . Platelet count 411,000 . Amylase 143 . Lipase was elevated to 600 . ESR was greater than 140 . Alkaline phosphatase 190 . ALT 52 . AST 65 . Beta hCG was negative . Urinalysis was positive for protein . Bilirubin 0.4 . Chest x-ray revealed clear lung fields . There was no evidence of rib fracture . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 03/03/92 - left carotid endarterectomy with continuous interoperative electroencephalogram monitoring and saphenous vein patch closure . ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES : Sep/24/05 cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography , 02/23/92 - transfemoral aortogram , bilateral carotid arteriogram , abdominal aortogram . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Patient is a 72 year old female with known carotid stenosis , and recent carotid noninvasives at an outside hospital , which showed 90% left sided stenosis . She has not had a stroke , or transient ischemic attack . She was recently discharged from the Per Naplesspecrycet Hospital after an admission for congestive heart failure . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As noted . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for having had a cholecystectomy and hysterectomy , tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy , and mastoidectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Insulin 44 units NPH qam ; 8 units qpm ; Vasotec 2.5 qd ; Lasix 40 qd ; Mevacor 40 qd ; Cardizem CD 180 qd ; Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection ; aspirin .

She has not had a stroke , or transient ischemic attack . She was recently discharged from the Per Naplesspecrycet Hospital after an admission for congestive heart failure . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As noted . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for having had a cholecystectomy and hysterectomy , tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy , and mastoidectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Insulin 44 units NPH qam ; 8 units qpm ; Vasotec 2.5 qd ; Lasix 40 qd ; Mevacor 40 qd ; Cardizem CD 180 qd ; Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection ; aspirin . ALLERGIES : Seldane causes gastrointestinal distress . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Clear chest . Cardiac : regular rate and rhythm . Extremities : revealed 2+ carotid pulses with bruits bilaterally , 2+ radial , 2+ femoral , 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION : Significant for BUN and creatinine 33/2.4 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Tau Memorial Hospital . She was seen by Dr. Freiermthalskush of the renal service for management of her chronic renal insufficiency . On 02/22 , she underwent angiography , which revealed minimal right internal carotid artery disease , and proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis , 2 cm in length for the 1 mm residual lumen . The left anterior communicating artery fell from the right . She was also seen by Cardiology , and she underwent cardiac catheterization , as part of her preop evaluation , which revealed normal resting hemodynamics , and a moderate posterior descending artery , and obtuse marginal stenoses . She was , therefore , cleared for the operating room , and on 3/3/92 , she underwent a left carotid endarterectomy , with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring and vein patch angioplasty , which was uneventful . Her postoperative course was marked only by prolonged ileus , perhaps secondary to constipation , with persistent vomiting , requiring intravenous fluids , however , on 03/07/92 , she had a large bowel movement , after aggressive bowel regime , felt significantly better , was able to tolerate PO &apos;s . She is now able to be discharged home on her admission medications , with the exception of the fact that Vasotec was increased to 10 mg PO bid .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 03/03/92 - left carotid endarterectomy with continuous interoperative electroencephalogram monitoring and saphenous vein [MASK]. ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES : Sep/24/05 cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography , 02/23/92 - transfemoral aortogram , bilateral carotid arteriogram , abdominal aortogram . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Patient is a 72 year old female with known carotid stenosis , and recent carotid noninvasives at an outside hospital , which showed 90% left sided stenosis . She has not had a stroke , or transient ischemic attack . She was recently discharged from the Per Naplesspecrycet Hospital after an admission for congestive heart failure . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As noted . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for having had a cholecystectomy and hysterectomy , tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy , and mastoidectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Insulin 44 units NPH qam ; 8 units qpm ; Vasotec 2.5 qd ; Lasix 40 qd ; Mevacor 40 qd ; Cardizem CD 180 qd ; Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection ; aspirin . ALLERGIES : Seldane causes gastrointestinal distress . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Clear chest . Cardiac : regular rate and rhythm . Extremities : revealed 2+ carotid pulses with bruits bilaterally , 2+ radial , 2+ femoral , 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION : Significant for BUN and creatinine 33/2.4 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Tau Memorial Hospital . She was seen by Dr. Freiermthalskush of the renal service for management of her chronic renal insufficiency . On 02/22 , she underwent angiography , which revealed minimal right internal carotid artery disease , and proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis , 2 cm in length for the 1 mm residual lumen . The left anterior communicating artery fell from the right . She was also seen by Cardiology , and she underwent cardiac catheterization , as part of her preop evaluation , which revealed normal resting hemodynamics , and a moderate posterior descending artery , and obtuse marginal stenoses . She was , therefore , cleared for the operating room , and on 3/3/92 , she underwent a left carotid endarterectomy , with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring and vein patch angioplasty , which was uneventful . Her postoperative course was marked only by prolonged ileus , perhaps secondary to constipation , with persistent vomiting , requiring intravenous fluids , however , on 03/07/92 , she had a large bowel movement , after aggressive bowel regime , felt significantly better , was able to tolerate PO &apos;s . She is now able to be discharged home on her admission medications , with the exception of the fact that Vasotec was increased to 10 mg PO bid .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 03/03/92 - left carotid endarterectomy with continuous interoperative electroencephalogram monitoring and saphenous vein patch closure . ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES : Sep/24/05 cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography , 02/23/92 - transfemoral aortogram , bilateral [MASK], abdominal aortogram . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Patient is a 72 year old female with known carotid stenosis , and recent carotid noninvasives at an outside hospital , which showed 90% left sided stenosis . She has not had a stroke , or transient ischemic attack . She was recently discharged from the Per Naplesspecrycet Hospital after an admission for congestive heart failure . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As noted . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for having had a cholecystectomy and hysterectomy , tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy , and mastoidectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Insulin 44 units NPH qam ; 8 units qpm ; Vasotec 2.5 qd ; Lasix 40 qd ; Mevacor 40 qd ; Cardizem CD 180 qd ; Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection ; aspirin . ALLERGIES : Seldane causes gastrointestinal distress . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Clear chest . Cardiac : regular rate and rhythm . Extremities : revealed 2+ carotid pulses with bruits bilaterally , 2+ radial , 2+ femoral , 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION : Significant for BUN and creatinine 33/2.4 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Tau Memorial Hospital . She was seen by Dr. Freiermthalskush of the renal service for management of her chronic renal insufficiency . On 02/22 , she underwent angiography , which revealed minimal right internal carotid artery disease , and proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis , 2 cm in length for the 1 mm residual lumen . The left anterior communicating artery fell from the right . She was also seen by Cardiology , and she underwent cardiac catheterization , as part of her preop evaluation , which revealed normal resting hemodynamics , and a moderate posterior descending artery , and obtuse marginal stenoses . She was , therefore , cleared for the operating room , and on 3/3/92 , she underwent a left carotid endarterectomy , with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring and vein patch angioplasty , which was uneventful . Her postoperative course was marked only by prolonged ileus , perhaps secondary to constipation , with persistent vomiting , requiring intravenous fluids , however , on 03/07/92 , she had a large bowel movement , after aggressive bowel regime , felt significantly better , was able to tolerate PO &apos;s . She is now able to be discharged home on her admission medications , with the exception of the fact that Vasotec was increased to 10 mg PO bid .

ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES : Sep/24/05 cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography , 02/23/92 - transfemoral aortogram , bilateral carotid arteriogram , abdominal aortogram . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Patient is a 72 year old female with known carotid stenosis , and recent carotid noninvasives at an outside hospital , which showed 90% left sided [MASK]. She has not had a stroke , or transient ischemic attack . She was recently discharged from the Per Naplesspecrycet Hospital after an admission for congestive heart failure . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As noted . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for having had a cholecystectomy and hysterectomy , tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy , and mastoidectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Insulin 44 units NPH qam ; 8 units qpm ; Vasotec 2.5 qd ; Lasix 40 qd ; Mevacor 40 qd ; Cardizem CD 180 qd ; Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection ; aspirin . ALLERGIES : Seldane causes gastrointestinal distress . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Clear chest . Cardiac : regular rate and rhythm . Extremities : revealed 2+ carotid pulses with bruits bilaterally , 2+ radial , 2+ femoral , 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION : Significant for BUN and creatinine 33/2.4 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Tau Memorial Hospital . She was seen by Dr. Freiermthalskush of the renal service for management of her chronic renal insufficiency . On 02/22 , she underwent angiography , which revealed minimal right internal carotid artery disease , and proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis , 2 cm in length for the 1 mm residual lumen . The left anterior communicating artery fell from the right . She was also seen by Cardiology , and she underwent cardiac catheterization , as part of her preop evaluation , which revealed normal resting hemodynamics , and a moderate posterior descending artery , and obtuse marginal stenoses . She was , therefore , cleared for the operating room , and on 3/3/92 , she underwent a left carotid endarterectomy , with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring and vein patch angioplasty , which was uneventful . Her postoperative course was marked only by prolonged ileus , perhaps secondary to constipation , with persistent vomiting , requiring intravenous fluids , however , on 03/07/92 , she had a large bowel movement , after aggressive bowel regime , felt significantly better , was able to tolerate PO &apos;s . She is now able to be discharged home on her admission medications , with the exception of the fact that Vasotec was increased to 10 mg PO bid .

Unsigned DIS Report Status : Unsigned ADMISSION DATE : 02/22/92 DISCHARGE DATE : 03/08/92 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : left coronary artery stenosis . ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : diabetes mellitus with diabetic renopathy , renovascular occlusive disease , with thrombosis of the right renal artery , hypertension , probably renal vascular , hypertensive cardiac disease with history of congestive heart failure , chronic renal insufficiency , coronary artery disease . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 03/03/92 - left carotid endarterectomy with continuous interoperative electroencephalogram monitoring and saphenous vein patch closure . ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES : Sep/24/05 cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography , 02/23/92 - transfemoral aortogram , bilateral carotid arteriogram , abdominal aortogram . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Patient is a 72 year old female with known carotid stenosis , and recent carotid noninvasives at an outside hospital , which showed 90% left sided stenosis . She has not had a stroke , or transient ischemic attack . She was recently discharged from the Per Naplesspecrycet Hospital after an admission for congestive heart failure . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As noted . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for having had a cholecystectomy and hysterectomy , tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy , and mastoidectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Insulin 44 units NPH qam ; 8 units qpm ; Vasotec 2.5 qd ; Lasix 40 qd ; Mevacor 40 qd ; Cardizem CD 180 qd ; Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection ; aspirin . ALLERGIES : Seldane causes gastrointestinal distress . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Clear chest . Cardiac : regular rate and rhythm . Extremities : revealed 2+ [MASK]pulses with bruits bilaterally , 2+ radial , 2+ femoral , 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION : Significant for BUN and creatinine 33/2.4 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Tau Memorial Hospital . She was seen by Dr. Freiermthalskush of the renal service for management of her chronic renal insufficiency . On 02/22 , she underwent angiography , which revealed minimal right internal carotid artery disease , and proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis , 2 cm in length for the 1 mm residual lumen . The left anterior communicating artery fell from the right . She was also seen by Cardiology , and she underwent cardiac catheterization , as part of her preop evaluation , which revealed normal resting hemodynamics , and a moderate posterior descending artery , and obtuse marginal stenoses . She was , therefore , cleared for the operating room , and on 3/3/92 , she underwent a left carotid endarterectomy , with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring and vein patch angioplasty , which was uneventful . Her postoperative course was marked only by prolonged ileus , perhaps secondary to constipation , with persistent vomiting , requiring intravenous fluids , however , on 03/07/92 , she had a large bowel movement , after aggressive bowel regime , felt significantly better , was able to tolerate PO &apos;s . She is now able to be discharged home on her admission medications , with the exception of the fact that Vasotec was increased to 10 mg PO bid .

Unsigned DIS Report Status : Unsigned ADMISSION DATE : 02/22/92 DISCHARGE DATE : 03/08/92 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : left coronary artery stenosis . ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : diabetes mellitus with diabetic renopathy , renovascular occlusive disease , with thrombosis of the right renal artery , hypertension , probably renal vascular , hypertensive cardiac disease with history of congestive heart failure , chronic renal insufficiency , coronary artery disease . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 03/03/92 - left carotid endarterectomy with continuous interoperative electroencephalogram monitoring and saphenous vein patch closure . ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES : Sep/24/05 cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography , 02/23/92 - transfemoral aortogram , bilateral carotid arteriogram , abdominal aortogram . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Patient is a 72 year old female with known carotid stenosis , and recent carotid noninvasives at an outside hospital , which showed 90% left sided stenosis . She has not had a stroke , or transient ischemic attack . She was recently discharged from the Per Naplesspecrycet Hospital after an admission for congestive heart failure . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As noted . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for having had a cholecystectomy and hysterectomy , tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy , and mastoidectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Insulin 44 units NPH qam ; 8 units qpm ; Vasotec 2.5 qd ; Lasix 40 qd ; Mevacor 40 qd ; Cardizem CD 180 qd ; Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection ; aspirin . ALLERGIES : Seldane causes gastrointestinal distress . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Clear chest . Cardiac : regular rate and rhythm . Extremities : revealed 2+ carotid pulses with bruits bilaterally , 2+ radial , 2+ femoral , 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION : Significant for BUN and creatinine 33/2.4 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Tau Memorial Hospital . She was seen by Dr. Freiermthalskush of the renal service for management of her chronic renal insufficiency . On 02/22 , she underwent angiography , which revealed minimal [MASK]disease , and proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis , 2 cm in length for the 1 mm residual lumen . The left anterior communicating artery fell from the right . She was also seen by Cardiology , and she underwent cardiac catheterization , as part of her preop evaluation , which revealed normal resting hemodynamics , and a moderate posterior descending artery , and obtuse marginal stenoses . She was , therefore , cleared for the operating room , and on 3/3/92 , she underwent a left carotid endarterectomy , with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring and vein patch angioplasty , which was uneventful . Her postoperative course was marked only by prolonged ileus , perhaps secondary to constipation , with persistent vomiting , requiring intravenous fluids , however , on 03/07/92 , she had a large bowel movement , after aggressive bowel regime , felt significantly better , was able to tolerate PO &apos;s . She is now able to be discharged home on her admission medications , with the exception of the fact that Vasotec was increased to 10 mg PO bid .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present . No autopsy was obtained .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present . No autopsy was obtained .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be [MASK]with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .

He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .

LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for [MASK], managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .

Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .

His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present . No autopsy was obtained .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , [MASK]148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , [MASK]was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and [MASK]13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present . No autopsy was obtained .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of [MASK], a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .

Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began [MASK]and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . He had no cardiac murmur . His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . LABORATORY DATA : Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells . There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried [MASK]and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .
