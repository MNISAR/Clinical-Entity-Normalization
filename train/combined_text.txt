LABORATORY DATA : Chem-7 - Na 139 , K 3.7 , Cl 99 , bicarb 28 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 89 . Liver function tests were significant for an ALT 41 , AST 31 , alk phos 76 , T. bili 0.7 , D. bili 0.2 , amylase 345 , lipase 2510 , T. protein 8.1 , albumin 4.9 , globulin 3.2 , Ca 9.9 . CBC - White blood cell count 8.82 , hemoglobin 15.2 , hematocrit 43 , and platelets 322 . Imaging studies : Abdominal CT scan on 2/21/00 - Study revealed a prominent pancreas with associated mesenteric stranding . No abscess or pseudocyst . A small gallstone was noted in the gallbladder neck . Bilateral pleural effusion were seen with associated compression atelectasis . Abdominal ultrasound on 2/23/00 - This study revealed gallbladder sludge but no cholelithiasis . There was swelling of the body and tail of the pancreas .

HOSPITAL COURSE : On admission , the patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis . He was made NPO and was resuscitated with IV fluids . Pain control was initiated with morphine but was then changed to Demerol , which gave the patient better relief of his epigastric pain . From 2/17/00 to 2/21/00 , the patient complained of persistent and occasionally severe epigastric pain . His pain medication was then changed to Dilaudid IV in an attempt to better alleviate his symptoms . Dilaudid IV was continued for the remainder of the patient &apos;s hospitalization . The does was titrated to the patient &apos;s need for comfort and was eventually tapered . The severity and persistent of the patient &apos;s epigastric pain was concerning for a pancreatic complication such as necrosis or abscess . The patient had a CT scan , which revealed a mass in the gallbladder neck , but no biliary dilatation . There was stranding along the pancreas , but no necrosis , abscess , or pseudocyst . On 2/22/00 , the patient had fevers to 103.5 . Blood and urine cultures were sent . A chest x-ray was done , which revealed no infiltrate or effusion .

An ultrasound was done to R / O cholestasis or cholangitis . The ultrasound showed biliary sludge and swelling of the body and tail of the pancreas . No other abnormalities were noted . On 2/24/00 , the patient had an episode of exacerbation of epigastric pain with radiation to the left upper quadrant . The pain was subsequently relieved with high dose Dilaudid . The patient had a follow-up chest x-ray , which was essentially unchanged from previously , showing a normal heart and lungs without infiltrate . From 2/25 - 2/27/00 , the patient &apos;s fever defervesced and his abdominal pain gradually subsided . The cefotaxime was discontinued since no infection was identified .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : 1. Pill esophagitis . 2. Right ventricular hypokinesis . OPERATIONS / PROCEDURES : Dobutamine stress test , cardiac ultrasound , EGD , chest x-ray , PICC placement . The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , COPD , hypercholesterolemia , depression and CHF who was lying in bed on the night prior to admission when she developed left-sided chest pain located in the mid-breast region with some fluttering her chest . The patient radiated down her left arm associated with some nausea , no shortness of breath , cough , vomiting , diarrhea . She slept through the night , woke with persistent pain . She went with her sister &apos;s husband to La Community Hospital where she was given sublingual nitroglycerin with complete relief of pain . She refused ambulance to the Emergency Room and was driven to Well General Hospital Emergency Room by her sister . She arrived pain free . She was given Aspirin , Lopressor and Insulin for hyperglycemia . EKG was unchanged compared to the prior EKG several months ago . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , depression , back pain , COPD , allergic rhinitis , GERD , obesity , hyperlipidemia . ALLERGIES : Codeine , reaction unknown . MEDICATIONS : Atrovent . Aspirin . Flonase . Quinine Celebrex . Compazine . Oxybutynin Amitriptyline . Zyrtec . Prozac . Trazodone . Humulin 70 units bid . Albuterol . Lasix 40 PO bid . Triamcinolone cream . Miconazole cream Flovent . Nifedipine ER 60 daily . Lisinopril , 30 daily . KCl 10 mEq q day . Protonix , 40 daily . Lipitor , 20 daily . Methadone 10 bid . FAMILY HISTORY : Non-contributory . HABITS : Tobacco : Quit 20 years ago . Alcohol : Rare drinks per week . SOCIAL HISTORY : Lives along , takes care of herself . Retired . Used to work in fast food . VITAL SIGNS : On admission blood pressure 165/70 . temperature 99.8 , pulse 86 , respiratory rate 18 . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Obese , no acute distress . Multiple tattoos . Skin normal . HEENT , ears poor hearing . Extraocular movements intact . Moist mucous membranes . No lymphadenopathy . Chest , lungs clear to auscultation with faint wheezes , no rales . Cardiac , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops . Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended . Positive bowel sounds . Neurologic : Alert and oriented x3 . Cranial nerves II through XII intact . Motor and sensory intact . Extremities : Feet no edema . Pulses 2+ PT and DP . LABORATORY : Unremarkable with normal electrolytes except for glucose of 328 . CBC , white count 6.7 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 280 . Chest x-ray was low lung volumes , no consolidation . EKG showed sinus brady at 16 , normal axis , normal intervals , no STT wave abnormalities . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to Team Four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for MI . Hospital course by system : 1. Cardiovascular : The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers . The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension . The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) . This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality . However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic . It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given . The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 . This responded to fluid bolus . The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status . The patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test . This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% . Clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine . 2. Infectious Disease : On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion . The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI . She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates . She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin . Her urine legionella antigen was negative . On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum . She was started on vancomycin for this . These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin . She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration . 3. GI : The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis . GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses . Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD . The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis . Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus . 4. Shortness of breath : As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge . At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula . This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT . 5. Derm : Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast . She was started on some Miconazole Cream . The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side . The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE : Tums , 500-1250 mg PO tid . Albuterol inhaler . Lipitor , 20 daily . Prozac , 60 daily . Flovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid . Atrovent , two puffs qid . Ditropan , 5 mg tid . Colace , 100 mg tid . Aspirin , 325 mg daily . Insulin NPH , 36 subcu q AM , 30 subcu q PM . Nystatin Mouthwash Swish and Swallow . Nexium , 20 mg PO daily . Vancomycin 1 gm IV q12h . The patient will follow-up with her primary care provider , Dr. Na Fongbain at the Cord Memorial Hospital .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is an 82 year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status . He was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead . On the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak . The family reported one episode of vomiting at home . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : The patient was afebrile , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 158/53 , respiratory rate 16-20 , oxygen saturation 97% on three liters . General : The patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing . Neck was supple with full range of motion . No bruits were heard . Chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry . Heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . Abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present . Extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema . Neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech . Pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally . There was no pupillary defect . Dolls eye was negative . There was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes . Corneals were present bilaterally . Gag was present weakly . Face was symmetrical . Tongue was midline . The patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time . There was only minimal movement on the left side . On sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain . Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over . The left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing . LABORATORY : Laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 . AST was 20 , ALT 12 , alkaline phosphatase 80 , bilirubin 0.5. CK was 113 . Thyroid function tests were normal . Troponin I was 0.05 . Total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. White blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 . Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 . PT was 12.3 , PTT 27.1. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic T-waves in V1 to V3 without any acute changes . A chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation . The head CT scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin . Around 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted . Lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout . Neurologically , the patient was not following commands . Eyes were closed . He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before . Withdrawal to pain was still present . Both plantars were upgoing . A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask . EKG showed sinus tachycardia . The patient &apos;s temperature was 102 degrees . A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed . This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere . There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage . At this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit . An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation . The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons . The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries . The left vertebral artery was not visualized . There was a dominant right vertebral artery . There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left . There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries . Clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate . Neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation . The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management . Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage . The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole . The patient &apos;s family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis . The patient passed away at 6:45 AM on June 12 , 1998 . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE : Deceased . DISCHARGE ORDERS : None . Dictated By : GREGSIS STREETS , M.D. SQ51 Attending : CHLINO B.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : 1. hypertension , 2. poor dentition . ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS : no known drug allergies . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : NOne . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient is retired employee of the City of Avi Den , Hawaii , lives on a pension and Social Security . The patient has never been married and has no children . He has a sixty to seventy five pack year smoking history and drinks alcohol approximately one time per week . He denies any ilicit drug use . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : The patient is an obese male in no acute distress . The vital signs temperature 98.0 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 186/69 , respirations 18 . The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination revealed an entry wound approximately 1 1/2 inches above the right ear , which is approximately 1 cm. in length and surrounded by powder burn . There is a lump in the right parietal region , which corresponds with the bullet seen on the computerized tomography scan . There is no bruising about the eyes or mastoid sinuses , and there is no fluid from the nose or ears . The neck was supple , and without adenopathy . The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . The heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm and no murmur , rub or gallop are appreciated . The abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , without hepatosplenomegaly . There are no masses and the bowel sounds are present . The extremities are well perfused and there is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . Neurological : examination revealed a patient who was alert and oriented X 3 , with short term recall of 2/3 objects at five minutes and fluent speech . The patient remembers the presidents as Carter-Bush-Regan-Truman-Roosevelt . The patient was able to spell world backwards on the third attempt . He performed serial 7 &apos;s accurately . He demonstrated poor ability for abstract thinking . Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact . The pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the extra ocular movements are intact . The fundi are benign and the discs are sharp . The patient &apos;s strength is 5/5 throughout and the sensorium is intact . The deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical throughout . LABORATORY DATA : A panel of serum electrolytes is normal . The white blood count is 9.4 , hematocrit 47.1 , and the platelets 253,000 . Blood coagulation times are normal . Serum toxic screen is negative . Leukocyte differential count reveals 64 neutrophils , 24% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , 2% eosinophils , and 2% basophils . A panel of serum enzymes suggest normal hepatic function . A computerized tomography scan of the head reveals a small external skull fracture , approximately 1-2 millemeters in size , near the right frontoparietal apex . A right parietal contusion is also identified , with blood tracking into the middle focus . Standard 12 lead electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 85 , with poor R wave progression in leads V1 through V3 suggesting the possibility of an old anteroseptal myocardial infarction . Nonspecific ST segment and T wave abnormalities are present as well . Otherwise , the axis is normal and the intervals are normal . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D. Prior to his admission , the patient &apos;s gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room . The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid . The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge . The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter . Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended . From a medical standpoint , the patient did well . He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization . The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine . After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward . Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen . The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note . By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable . He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : Ischemic cardiomyopathy , orthotopic heart transplantation , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , coronary graft disease , medical noncompliance . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : Cardiac echocardiogram . OTHER PROCEDURES : None . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr. Vessels is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure . Mr. Vessels &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so . Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in January 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis . A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease . A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils . He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil . Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly . Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure . An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Notable for coronary artery disease , coronary allograft vasculopathy , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , CMV infection , hypertension , depression , and tricuspid regurgitation . Examination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities . His blood pressure is 130/80 and heart rate was 100. jugular venous pressure was increasing . Carotids were 2+ . Crackles were increased 1/4 of the way up . There was a left ventricular heave and an S3 galop . The abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished . LABORATORY DATA : Revealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% . The electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts . chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed . The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction . Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy . The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed . At 4:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest . Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated . Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed . The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure . There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions . A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid . A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure . In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate . The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM . The patient was pronounced dead . Patient &apos;s mother was informed by Dr. Vessels .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : acute renal insufficiency . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 72 year old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1983 , pulmonary hypertension , hepatitis C positive cirrhosis history with history of portal hypertension and status post an upper gastrointestinal bleed on 4-10-98 , who presents from Sondi Memorial for work up of pulmonary infiltrates , acute renal failure and pulmonary hypertension . The patient presented to Sondi Memorial on 4-10-98 with fatigue and fall , found to have a hematocrit of 29 , baseline 37 . The patient was transfused two units and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done where it showed gastritis , candidal esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices . A colonoscopy showed anteriordysplasia , no bleeding was seen . The patient was discharged after one week on iron sulfate . On 4-24 , the patient was seen again at Sondi Memorial when he experienced at home a fall , no loss of consciousness , positive substernal chest pain , pleuritic pain , shortness of breath and cough . He went to Sondi Memorial where he ruled out for myocardial infarction and was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate / pneumonia , started on cefuroxime . His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate despite aggressive chest physical therapy for possible blood , given Lasix for congestive heart failure , became hypotensive , hypoxic and intubated . The patient was found to have expanding pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray , developed acute renal insufficiency with minimal urine output , less than 10 cc an hour , started on dopamine for hemodynamic instability . An echocardiogram was obtained on 4-26 which showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal _____ left ventricular function , severe right ventricular dilatation with septal hypokinesis and flattening with a question of right ventricular apical clot raised with mild aortic stenosis , severe tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 70 millimeters , consistent with fairly severe pulmonary hypertension .

Unsigned DIS Report Status : Unsigned ADMISSION DATE : 4/28/93 DISCHARGE DATE : 5/15/93 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : Right thyroid papillary carcinoma . ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : 1. Pulmonary and right iliac bone metastases . 2. Eosinophilia . 3. Chronic leg edema . 4. Atrial fibrillation . 5. Congestive heart failure . 6. Left subclavian vein thrombosis . 7. Urinary tract infection . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath . The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue . She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months . Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted . A work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils . She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation . Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable . The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 . A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers . Chromosomal studies were negative . A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area . A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass . This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst . Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid . An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable . The small bowel follow through was within normal limits . A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side . A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly . The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain . She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss . She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion . A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma . The patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Includes a history of atrial fibrillation with good heart rate control on Digoxin . She reports no prior surgical history . The patient also reports no known drug allergy .

She had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea . She had no jugular venous distention or bruits . The lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up . She had no definite S3 . The liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin . Her spleen could not be palpated . She had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally . LABORATORY DATA : On admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes . Her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7/10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement . Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome . Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed . This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation . A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results . During this time the patient &apos;s coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing . ANCA serum results were negative . ANA results were also nonsuggestive . The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein . There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well . A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain . Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun . Meanwhile , the patient &apos;s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone . She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea . The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases . Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention . On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .

On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy . Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively . She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected . She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation . Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin . She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 . She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma . She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day . DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS : Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE : Coumadin , 5 mg po alternating with 2.5 mg po ; prednisolone , 30 mg po bid ; hydrochlorothiazide , 50 mg po bid ; potassium chloride , 40 mEq po bid ; Augmentin , 500 mg po tid ; Digoxin , 0.125 mg po qd ; Tylenol , 650 mg po q4h prn ; Carafate , 1 gram po bid ; Synthroid , 0.125 mg po qd . DISPOSITION : The patient was discharged home with Terchestlumnesamp Medical Center referral for weekly blood tests , potassium and PT . The patient is also to keep her left arm elevated and to remain on a low sodium diet . She will be maintained on a PT between 15 and 17 with Coumadin .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 60 year old diabetic who underwent an APR in 1989 for rectal carcinoma and has been doing following radiation therapy and 5FU . He recently developed fatigue and dyspnea and workup disclosed a large liver mass which was biopsied and revealed to be poorly differentiated neoplasm most consistent with metastatic rectal discontinued . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : remarkable for diabetes mellitus , premature ventricular contractions , rectal carcinoma , diabetic neuropathy both peripherally and involving the right diaphragm . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE : Diabeta 10 mg. po. bid . Serax 20 mg. po. qhs . Sudafed 30 mg. po. bid . Theo-dur 300 mg. po. bid . Betoptic 0.5% one drop OU bid , Propene 0.1% one drop OU bid , Pred-Forte 1% one drop OS bid , Percocet two tabs. po. q4hours prn . Proventil 2 puffs q6hours prn . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : includes and abdominoperineal resection in 1989 . ALLERGIES : no known drug allergies PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : demonstrated an obese man in no acute distress . The blood pressure 140/75 , pulse 90 and irregular , respirations 20 . The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat and neck examinations were unremarkable . Cardiac examination was remarkable for frequent ectopic beats . The lung examination was clear but breath sounds were more pronounced on the left than the right . Abdomen : soft , obese with mild epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness . An intact colostomy was present . No masses could be palpated secondary to the patient &apos;s extreme obesity . Extremities : unremarkable . The neurological examination was remarkable for a peripheral neuropathy including decreased sensation in the lower extremities with decreased strength in the upper and lower extremities most pronounced in the legs and feet . A chest X-ray demonstrated right hemidiaphragmatic elevation . The electrocardiogram was remarkable for trigeminy at 91 per minute . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and underwent celiac and superior mesenteric artery angiography which demonstrated a patent celiac and superior mesenteric artery with normal branching pattern . His preoperative workup was completed and included a normal white count , hematocrit 42 . normal electrolytes , normal coags and normal renal function . On 10-02-94 the patient was brought to the operating room where he underwent exploratory laparotomy and left hepatectomy and cholecystectomy by Dr. Duhenile . The patient tolerated the procedure well with a 2000 cc. blood loss and was autotransfused two units of blood . In the postoperative course Mr. Fyfe did surprisingly well given his underlying medical condition . , He did require two units of transfused blood but otherwise did quite well and was extubated on the night of surgery . He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for two days but was hemodynamically stable throughout . He continued to manifest occasional premature ventricular contractions , but these were unchanged from preoperatively and the patient otherwise did well . His nasogastric tube was discontinued and he was begun on clear liquids and subsequently advanced to a regular diet without difficulty . Both of his Jackson-Pratt drains were removed without incident .

Ventricular ectopy . 3. Pulmonary hypertension . 4. Cardiomegaly . 5. Sinus tachycardia . 6. Diabetes mellitus . 7. Paraphimosis . 8. Right bundle branch block . 9. Pericarditis . ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS : Heparin , consisting of thrombocytopenia ; Pronestyl , consisting of nausea . SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS : 08/02/93 : coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 . 08/02/93 : left internal mammary artery to anterior descending artery x 1 . 08/02/93 : Insertion of intra-aortic balloon pump . 07/30/93 : bilateral cardiac catheterization . 07/30/93 : Left ventriculography . 07/30/93 : bilateral coronary angiography . 08/02/93 : Signal average EKG . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE : Digoxin , .25 mg PO QD ; Ecotrin , 325 mg QD ; Coumadin , 2.5 mg PO QD ; Lisinopril , 2.5 mg PO QD ; Micronase , 5 mg PO BID . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. Laymie Fournier and Dr. Leebjescobe in Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in May 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center . He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus . He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time . A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts . He was started on aspirin . He has a family history of hypertension as well . He was also placed on Vasotec . A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy . A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise . An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis . Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Blood pressure 140/100 , phosphorus 94 , weight 181 lb . Head , neck : unremarkable . Lungs clear . Carotids normal . Cardiac : Loud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur . Abdomen was benign . Peripheral pulses intact . Neurological : Nonfocal . LABORATORY DATA : Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 . Cholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 . Hematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 . MCV was 85 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 . This lowered with IV nitroglycerin . Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion . He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD . His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis . The situation was reviewed with his wife , Sligh . She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 . It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation . Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin . He stabilized over the weekend . He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor . He developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent . He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time . He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes . Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy . The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. Slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery . On 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting . He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow . A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig . After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia . He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated . He had good hemodynamics . He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats . His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit . He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus . On 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal . Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin . He remained in normal sinus rhythm . He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable . He had a right bundle branch block . He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin . Therefore he was able to be discharged home . He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .

Native hepatectomy . Re-exploration for bleeding . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr. Villesatelkscurb is a fifty year old black gentleman with a long history of hepatitis C , believed to be contracted during transfusions in a previous trauma . The patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma . The patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant . PAST MEDICAL and SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma . ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS : no known drug allergies . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : On admission medications included Lasix and iron . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Significant for normal head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam with no scleral icterus . Heart regular rate and rhythm , his lungs were clear . He had no appreciable ascites . He did have clubbing and palmar erythema with bilateral ankle edema . He was Neurologically intact . LABORATORY DATA : bilirubin to be .6 . SGOT of 80 . HOSPITAL COURSE : Preoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma . The remainder of his preoperative course was benign . On July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant . His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets . Postoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding . Initially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema . He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys . The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death . He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy . He also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis . His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid . While in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin . However , he became progressively more mentally obtunded . During the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding . Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis . He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest . He was pronounced dead at 3:49 PM on July 15 , 1992 . STA TITCHEGRIESESC , M.D. DICTATING FOR ; KIVERL NA CANTSLEDDJESC , M.D. TR : wj / bmot DD : 07/28/92 TD : 07/28/92 CC :

The patient has had multiple previous admissions for cardiac and pulmonary disease . He has had chronic anemia since 1990 , but a bone marrow biopsy in 07-92 , was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome . Over the past several months , the patient has had increasing transfusing requirements . His transfusions have been complicated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure , secondary to ischemia cardiomyopathy . His last admission was 9-14-93 , for a transfusion without complications , and prior to admission the patient reports having several days of increasing weakness , dizziness and fatigue . His wife says his hands and lips have been blue . Apparently , he had had a low hematocrit as an outpatient and was checked two weeks prior to admission but was not given transfusion because the patient did not want to come in at that time . Aside from the above , the patient had felt that baseline without fever and chills or change in chronic cough . He had no increase in his congestive heart failure symptoms , no chest pain , and no hemoptysis or changed in arthritis . The patient did report taking a po antibiotic ( Ciprofloxacin ) for right great toe infection ( question of cellulitis vs. paronychia ) . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : 1. Myelodysplastic syndrome . 2. Coronary artery disease / ischemiccardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 30% . 3. History of MAT for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease / chronic bronchi ectasis , on home oxygen . 4.

The patient lives with his wife and is a retired sardine packer . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Vital signs : Temperature 98.8 ; heart rate 88-120 and irregular ; blood pressure 118/78 ; O2 saturation 96% on 2 liters . HEENT : Bilateral cataracts ; neck appeared to be somewhat asymmetric thyroid with small nodule barely palpable on the left lobe with the thyroid , otherwise negative . No lymphadenopathy was palpated . Lungs : Rales 1/3 of the way upbilaterally . Cardiovascular examination revealed jugular venous distention at 12 cm , no carotid bruits , heart rate was tachycardic and regular , normal S1 and S2 , palpable S4 , no murmur was auscultated . Abdominal examination : Obese , soft , non-tender , bowel sounds were present . Rectal examination : Heme negative . Extremities : Joint deformities consistent with rheumatoid arthritis , right MTP / toe with minimal erythema . Skin examination : Diffuse psoriasis over trunk and arms . Neurological examination was non-focal . LABORATORY DATA : SMA-7 was unremarkable aside form a creatinine of 1.6 and a glucose of 207 ; otherwise , was within normal limits . Hematocrit was 22.4 ; white count .59 ; platelets 84. The patient had an absolute neutropenia with a ANC of 318 ; differential revealed 48 segs , 6 bands , 40 lymphs , 4 monos . Digoxin level was 1.4 . Theo-Dur level was 15 . PT was 12.5 ; PTT 27.0 . Urinalysis was within normal limits . Chest x-ray showed enlarged heart with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution , no gross congestive heart failure was noted . EKG showed question of MAT vs. atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 118 , axis was 0 degrees . There was ST scooping in the lateral leads consistent with Dig vs. a question of chronic ischemia changes . There was no significant change from his baseline EKG . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions . He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion . Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units . The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells . He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day . His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 . The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions . It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits . In addition , multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative . The patient was discharged with follow-up with his Hematologist , Dr. Eci Area and Rheumatologist , Dr. Taange Peter , and Cardiologist , Dr. Peter .

He was noted to have dark stools per rectum and to be somewhat fluid overloaded . HOSPITAL COURSE : He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 . He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload . His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy . He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d. The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization . During the course of his hospitalization , he became increasingly lethargic . An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing . He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy . He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus . In the few days prior to his demise , he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of June 25 , 1999 , his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13,000 . That day , he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies . He was put on 100% nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties . Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out . He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth . Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 . Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 . A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 . Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first . The family was called and came in to see the patient . An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit . In the acute setting , he had been started on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and Vancomycin . These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures . The patient was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate . At 2:30 on June 26 , 1999 , I was called to see the patient who had expired . DISPOSITION : The family was notified and came in to see the patient . The family declined an autopsy saying that they felt that the patient had been through enough . The patient &apos;s attending physician , Dr. Erm Neidwierst , was notified as well . Dictated By : CONRELLIE KOTERUDES , M.D. UK0 Attending : ERM K.

The patient has a Greenfield filter in . He has multiple decubiti on his buttocks and penis . He had a gastric pull up in 1992 of the stomach into the left thorax and he has a transverse colostomy and a sinus tract on the abdomen . ALLERGIES : Bactrim and Vancomycin . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Albuterol inhaler . Amphotericin B 40 mg. qday . Ceftazidime 1 gram intravenous q 8 . Ciprofloxacin 500 mg. po. q12 . Cisapride 10 mg. po. qid .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then . Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis . He had a pericardial window . He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer . He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound . He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management . We discussed the risks with his family . It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath . The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success . SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS : esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on December 4 , 1995 by Dr. Reg Cranka and Dr. Win Shufffyfe . In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status . 1. Neurologic and Psychologic : The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression . He is a paraplegic from T4 down . Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities . The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease . 2. Cardiac : The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure . He had a cardiac catheterization on December 1 , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension . The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal . A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials . The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on December 11 , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% . There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation . There is trace pulmonary insufficiency . The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on December 6 , 1995 . A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records . The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition . 3. Respiratory : the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest . These may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed . The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge . The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal . His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours . 3. GI : The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy . The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on December 25 , 1995 . This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract . There is no fistula seen . Dr. Asha Vengloan of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition . The patient takes poorly his po. diet . However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s . He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding . The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines . 4. GU : The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes . It has been noted to be improving . The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed . Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes . 5. Skin : The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti . Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. Ca Shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point . These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings . The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased . 6. Infectious Disease : The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits . The patient remains on Fluconazole . His other antibiotics were discontinued . His most recent cultures are negative . The chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia . 7. Pain . The patient has been very closely with the Pain Service here while admitted . He has been placed on Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain . The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued . The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior . The patient for sleep was given Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the Oxycodone . A complete summary of the patient &apos;s medications are as follows : Cimetidine 300 mg. intravenous q6hours . Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours . Senokot two tablets po. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon po. bid . Nortriptyline 25 mg. po. qhs . KCL 40 mEq. po. bid . Saline wet to dry dressing changes three times daily to penis and pelvis decubiti , 40% humidified oxygen , Fluconazole 200 mg. po. bid . Lasix 2.5 mg. intravenous qid . Prilosec 20 mg. po. qd . Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. po. qhs prn . Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3 hours prn . Physicians that took care of this patient while at the Ph University Of Medical Center are as follows : Admitting Physician and Thoracic Surgeon : Reg Cranka , M.D. Consulting General Surgeon was Asha Vengloan , M.D. Consulting Urology was Ryna Baker , M.D. Consulting Plastic Surgeon : Ca Shuff , M.D. Consulting Cardiologist : Cealme Maressythe , M.D. Consulting Cardiac Surgeon : Win Shufffyfe , M.D. Infectious Disease Consultant : Dr. Jesc . Psychiatry : Dr. Rencobe and Dr. Saddbeem . Pain Service : Dr. Shuff . In summary this is a 25 year old male with a very complicated history and a patient of Dr. Breunkays &apos;s . The patient was seen at Ph University Of Medical Center for problem regarding his constrictive pericarditis and underwent a surgical procedure to correct this . Followup cardiac studies showed there was a resolution of his constrictive pericarditis . The patient also had a gastric ulcer repaired at the same time . Other issues of the patient are chronic and most likely will be followed up in hospitals closer to the patient &apos;s home . If there are any questions regarding his care they should be directed to Dr. Cranka &apos;s office at Ph University Of Medical Center and we will be happy to contact any or all of the consultations concerned with Hauth &apos;s care . Hauth is a very complicated patient and it was our pleasure to provide care for him at Ph University Of Medical Center .

The patient was having a hard time walking and reports that he has felt weaker . He has had uncoordination of his feet and began having a cane four to five months ago with the increasing weakness . This was especially bad when trying to arise . The patient has seen his primary care physician who referred him to physical therapy for his gait weakness but his symptoms failed to improve . He continued to progress until two weeks prior to admission when he was found in the bathtub , unsteady and fell trying to steady himself . The patient could not be moved and had to have 911 called for help . Since that time he had been ambulating with a walker and has had increasing difficulty with falls in the last two weeks . The patient was again seen by his primary care physician and a CG scan revealed a mass in the right parietal lobe . The patient was referred to the Neurology Service for further workup of the mass . The patient denied blurry vision , headache , nausea , vomiting , paresthesias , pain in mental status , confusion or seizures .

His gait was unsteady and he was unable to stand on his own . Mental status : he was alert and oriented x3 . RELEVANT LABORATORY DATA : White blood cell count on admission 6.1 , INR on admission 1.0 , relevant imaging . Echocardiogram June 2004 showed an EF of 77% . Chest xray reveals no consolidation or signs of edema . CT shows a right parietal hyperdense and heterogenously enhancing mass measuring 6.5 x 5 cm with the surrounding vasogenic edema in effacement of the right lateral ventricle . The finding was most consistent with metastatic disease and less likely primary CNS neoplasm such as glioblastoma . MRI showed a large heterogenous enhancing right parietal mass lesion with a possible ependymal spread . The patient was admitted to the Neurologic Service for workup of his tumor . The neuro-oncologist felt that because of the tremendous tumor burden that was likely causing his symptoms the patient will require open debulking as well as obtaining issue for a pathologic diagnosis . Thea patient was referred to Dr. Coma of the Eragnes Houseco Ardbay Memorial Hospital . On May 5 , 2005 the patient was taken to the operating room for a right parietal occipital craniotomy and debulking of the tumor using stulz neuro navigation . Please see the separately dictated operative report for further details of the procedure . The patient was taken to the recovery room and then to the postoperative floor in stable condition . Of note the patient was seen by cardiology for preoperative assessment . The patient was also seen by physical and occupational therapy during his postoperative course and they recommended that he go to a rehabilitation facility for his recovery . A postoperative MRI was obtained which revealed no remarkable findings but only post surgical changes . Transcranial Dopplers were checked following surgery and the patient was started on Decadron 4 mg q6 to prevent swelling . The patient was started on Fragmin for DVT prophylaxis and the patient was also started on Dilantin levels . Of note on 5/9/05 the patient was seen by Urology due to an inability to void and a 16 French Coude catheter was placed . The patient then was given voiding trials but eventually he needed to be straight cathed prn . At the time of transfer , a 16 Coude catheter was in place and draining well . The patient can have voiding trials at rehab and he is being maintained on Flomax . The patient had a relatively unremarkable course and his neurologic status continued to improve following the operation . At the time of discharge the patient was alert and oriented x3 and able to swallow pureed and thick diet without a problem . On 5/11/05 repeat imaging revealed some edema and mass affect . The patient was given an IV load of Decadron and restarted on IV Decadron which was eventually transferred to po Decadron . The patient was also started on Mannitol . His pathology came back as a large grade IV glioma . The patient &apos;s pain was initially controlled with IV pain medications but at the time of discharge to the rehab facility he was able to control his pain on po pain medications . The patient did have a postoperative serum sodium in the 120s from the 130s three days postoperatively . An endocrine consult was obtained to help manage his serum electrolytes . The patient was started on three grams of sodium , 3x a day with fluid restriction . Over the next several days his sodium levels were followed and by 5/12/05 his plasma sodium was back to 136 . The patient was taken off fluid restriction . On 5/14/05 Mannitol was tapered and then d / c&apos;d. At the time of transfer the patient was stable and needed only physical and occupational therapy . The patient was oriented to person , place and time and opened eyes appropriately to speech when asked . The patient is hard of hearing . The patient had no complaints of pain .

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS : Epistaxis to Coumadin in the past . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : Cardiac catheterization 11/03 . OTHER PROCEDURE : Pulmonary function test 11/04 . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 68-year-old patient of Dr. Naka Jesc had two episodes of rheumatic fever as a teenager . She has had chronic atrial fibrillation . Coumadin has caused bleeding from the mouth and nose on two occasions , on one occasion with prothrombin time 13 , and has been replaced by anti-platelet agents . She has had recurrent syncope since age 6 . She has now had progressive heart failure . A Holter showed atrial fibrillation with period of ventricular bigemini . She cut down dramatically on smoking two years ago , but has continued to smoke , although , very recently , she admits to only &quot; two puffs &quot; per day . She has not had hypertension or diabetes , and says he has lowered her cholesterol from 333 to 197 by changing her diet . There is no family history of heart disease . She has been treated with Vanceril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . She has had one gram per day proteinuria with normal creatinine . She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 for a &quot; tumor &quot; . She has had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin held , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d. ALLERGIES : Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache . SOCIAL HISTORY : She does not drink . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Heart rate 86 , irregularly irregular , blood pressure 142/86 . Neck veins distended . Carotids normal . Chest clear . Apical impulse not palpable . Right ventricular heave . S1 normal . S2 narrowly physiologically split with accentuation of P2 . No S3 or opening snap . Grade II systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . Grade II decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . Diastolic rumble at the apex . Liver slightly pulsatile but no enlarged . Pulses normal to the femorals with weak dorsalis pedis pulses . Superficial varicose veins . No edema . LABORATORY DATA : Hematocrit 44 , potassium 4.0 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.2 , blood sugar 115 , Digoxin 1.4 . Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , incomplete right bundle branch block , right axis deviation , right ventricular hypertrophy and possible apical infarction . Chest x-ray showed left atrial , right ventricular and pulmonary arterial enlargement and interstitial edema with small , bilateral effusions . HOSPITAL COURSE : Cardiac catheterization was performed without complication from the right neck and right groin on the day of admission . Right atrial pressure was 12 with a wave form consistent with tricuspid regurgitation . There was no tricuspid valve gradient . Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly elevated at 120/60 . Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was markedly elevated at 38 , with a very large mitral valve gradient . There was little or no aortic valve gradient . Fich cardiac output was 3.0 and indexed 2.0 . Arterial oxygen saturation was 85 percent . There was minimal mitral valve calcification , normal left ventricular contraction , and 2+ mitral regurgitation into a large left atrium . There was minimal aortic valve calcification , mild ______________ thickening , normal open , and mild aortic regurgitation . There was mild atherosclerosis of the mid left anterior descending . FVC was 1.6 or 58 percent of predicted and FEV1 0.95 or 45 percent of predicted . Room air arterial blood gas was 56/40/7.45 . Because it would be ideal to place a mechanical valve if valve replacement rather that commissurotomy is needed , she was seen by Dr. Ca Shuff of ENT for her history of epistaxis . He identified no bleeding source , but felt that the risk of nasal hemorrhage on Coumadin could be minimized interventional neuroradiology occlusion of the arteries to the nose bilaterally . The patient was therefore referred to the Dr. A Eu Wave . The procedure could not be scheduled during this admission . The patient is , therefore , discharged after a three day hospitalization , with plans for re-admission for the neuroradiology procedure . This will be followed by a trial of Coumadin , and then by mitral commissurotomy or replacement and probable tricuspid annuloplasty by Dr. Riemund C. Wave . In the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased . Potassium replacement has caused , according to the patient , marked hyperkalemia in the past . DISCHARGE REGIMEN : Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. aspirin 1 q.d. , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.

Her left knee had 5 degrees of valgus , 120 degrees of flexion , full extension and slight valgus instability . She had no Lachmann or anterior drawer , she did have a mild effusion . She had normal sensation and pulses in both legs . LABORATORY DATA : On admission included a hematocrit of 34.2 . Potassium 4.4 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was cleared for surgery by Dr. Lupevickette Ca . Her EKG was normal . She was therefore taken to the Operating Room on 6/26 and underwent a left total knee arthroplasty losing 200 cc of blood in the procedure with two drains left in which were removed on the first postoperative day . She was slightly agitated on the first postoperative day but this resolved by the second postoperative day . Her epidural catheter was removed on 6/29 . The Foley catheter was removed on 6/29 and she had no difficulties voiding . Psychiatry Service saw her on 6/28 and recommended avoiding benzodiazepines and Haldol for agitation . She was prophylaxed with Kefzol perioperatively and with Coumadin postoperatively . She was also given whiskey spirits because of the fact that she drank one to two drinks of scotch per day . Her hematocrit was 31.4 on 6/29 with a PT of 18.2 Her PT drifted down to a level of 12.9 by 7/3 and therefore she will be discharged with 4 mg of Coumadin per day to be followed by the Coumadin Clinic at Cowerin Tonli Medical Center . She was discharged with a prescription for Tylenol #3 with Physical Therapy . She did quite well with Physical Therapy and was ambulating with a walker and crutches by 7/3/90 . She was able to flex her knees to 90 degrees by that time . She developed no problems with edema or with her wound during her hospital stay . She will follow-up with Dr. Koors in approximately five weeks . ________________________________ IA605/6041 DE KOORS , M.D. CU2 D : 07/03/90 Batch : 1726 Report : J0929X49 T : 07/04/90 Dicatated By : LENTNY FARSTNAPPSSHEE , M.D.

INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS 2. PRIOR HISTORY OF ANTERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION 3. EPISODE OF PULMONARY EDEMA 4. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA CHIEF COMPLAINT : The patient is a 40 year old male with a history of prior anterior myocardial infarction and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from an outside hospital after an episode of acute shortness of breath and pulmonary edema . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient has a history four years ago of being admitted to the Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction . The course had multiple complications requiring pressors . He had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion . The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well . His most recent echocardiogram in April of 1996 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall . The patient also had an electrocardiogram in April of 1996 which was negative following , however was at a low workload . The patient &apos;s was most recently admitted to Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center on Martin Luther King Day after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk . He had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea . He called the EMT &apos;s and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center . He was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction . His ECG showed no ischemic changes . He was then transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further management . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : (1) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus x 15 years with no retinopathy or foot lesions . (2) Bilateral cataracts . (3) In 1967 he had an orchiopexy for undescended testicle . (4) Coronary artery disease as above . ALLERGIES : No known drug allergies . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , Capoten 25 mg p.o. q.8h. , NPH insulin 28 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m. , Regular insulin 4 units q.a.m. and 4 units q.p.m. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. day , digoxin 0.25 mg. SOCIAL HISTORY : He lives with his two brothers and is on disability . He has a ten pack year history of smoking , quit in 1990 . He does not drink alcohol . FAMILY HISTORY : His mother and father both died secondary to myocardial infarction . One of his brothers has had a myocardial infarction . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Temperature 100.3 , heart rate 76 , blood pressure 100/78 , respiratory rate 16 , and an oxygen saturation of 96% on two liters . NECK : No jugular venous distention . CHEST : Clear to auscultation with no wheezes or rales . CARDIOVASCULAR : Regular rate and rhythm with no extra heart sounds and no murmurs . ABDOMEN : Benign . EXTREMITIES : No edema with 2+ pulses . LABORATORY DATA : BUN 25 and creatinine 1.4 . White count 6 and hematocrit 41.5 . PT 14.1 with an INR of 1.4 , PTT 36.7 . Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates and no pulmonary edema . Urinalysis was negative . Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 with normal intervals . He had flat T waves in I and aVL , which were unchanged from previous ECG . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted for further management of his pulmonary edema . It was felt that the patient possibly had a worsening of his coronary artery disease and therefore underwent cardiac catheterization on 01/17/96 . At cardiac catheterization he had an RA pressure of 8 , an RV pressure of 52/10 , PA pressure of 60/25 , and wedge of 26 . His coronary arteries revealed an 80% stenosis and a large OM . The dominant left circumflex was occluded with left-to-left filling . He also had a 50% LAD stenosis , a 100% large DT stenosis and a nondominant RCA with left RCA collaterals . It was felt that this cardiac catheterization was not significantly changed from his previous catheterization . Given his high right-sided filling pressure , he was started on Lasix for diuresis and his Captopril was increased for greater afterload reduction . It was felt that the patient should have an augmented medical regimen and as an outpatient undergo an exercise tolerance test with viability evaluation to determine whether he would benefit from revascularization .

498710998 CMC 14172445 04/29/1992 12:00:00 AM Discharge Summary Signed DIS Admission Date : 04/29/1992 Report Status : Signed Discharge Date : 05/28/1992 DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES : 1. Carotid stenosis . 2. Aortic stenosis . 3. Coronary artery disease . PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on 04-29-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment . The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; . She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea . She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest . The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement . Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history . Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in Otte A , New Jersey and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 . She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy . She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally . She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension . Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 . HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable . Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur . Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally . Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected . Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds . Extremi-ties : There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable . LAB / X-RAY DATA : Labs on admission : Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 . EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves . HOSPITAL COURSE : She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery . Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; . On 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy . This was performed by Dr. Medicine and Dr. Room . The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature . She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness . On 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected . There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted . On 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later . However , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination . She was begun on a heparin drip . On 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia . She underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy . She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness . She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid . She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities . She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement . DISPOSITION : She is transferred to Rockdempbanri Hospital on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation . Discharge medications : Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion . Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response and digitalis effect as well as left ventricular hypertrophy . IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION : Impression was that this was an 83-year-old female with cardiac history , dyspnea on exertion , increased calcium and hyperparathyroidism who presents for parathyroidectomy . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : On the day of admission , the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy . The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma . Her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place . Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative . The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR . However , on postoperative day number two , the patient in the afternoon noticed some tingling in her hands and also some tingling hear her perioral region . She had a negative Chvostek &apos;s and negative Trousseau &apos;s sign . She had no muscular weakness noted . An ionized calcium was drawn which was low at 1.0 . As a result , the patient was started on Os-Cal 250 mg PO q.i.d. On postoperative day number three , her ionized calcium was 1.06 and her Os-Cal was increased to 500 q.i.d. However , her ionized calcium decreased to 0.97 and she was given one amp of calcium gluconate . On postoperative day number five , the patient felt fine and had an INR of 1.9 with a prothrombin time of 16.6 . Her calcium was 8.5 , albumin 3.6 , and phosphate 4.5 .

723989226 OMH 6410178 996067 3/30/1999 12:00:00 AM Discharge Summary Signed DIS Report Status : Signed DISCHARGE SUMMARY NAME : NETSHUFFSCARVTRACE , RIRA UNIT NUMBER : 005-27-20 ADMISSION DATE : 03/30/1999 DISCHARGE DATE : 09/16/2006 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Respiratory failure . Congestive heart failure . Right lower lobe pneumonia . Atonic bladder with suprapubic catheter . Anxiety . Coronary artery disease . History of colon cancer status post hemicolectomy . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia . He was most recently discharged from Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 . The patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area . The patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter . The patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed . The patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway . On the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath . The patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day . The patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum . He also denies any chest pain . No orthopnea . No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . The patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home . By the time the patient arrived at the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress . His initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 . The patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate . The patient was not intubated . However he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics . A chest x-ray in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs . There were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe . These were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Associated medical problems include : 1. Atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube . 2. Anxiety . 3. Coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past . 4. History of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : 1. Ativan 1 mg po twice a day . 2. Trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day . 3. Xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs . 4. Brimonidine 1 gtt left eye three times a day . 5. Combivent 3 puffs four times per day . 6. Aerobid three puffs twice a day . 7. Sorbitol 30 cc every other day . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : He was an elderly frail gentleman in moderate respiratory distress . He had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 . He was in moderate respiratory distress . His temperature was 98F . He had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam . Neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses . Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases . There were no wheezes or rhonchi . Heart exam revealed a soft S1 and S2 , no murmur was heard , no S3 . Abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable . Rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative . Neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male . He moved all extremities . Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities . LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA : Sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 on 40% 02 . Blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 . Urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells . Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit . He stayed in the unit for about one day . During that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol . He was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia . He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day . After one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment . This consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol . As the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved . A chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe . The patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia . The antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day . This was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days . The Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia . The patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal . It was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then . The patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix . While in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease . The patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease . The patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding . The patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec . While in Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently . It is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living . Discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home . They wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE : The patient &apos;s respiratory status was stable . I think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had . He needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for Physical Therapy to increase his muscle strength . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE : 1. Albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h . 2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day . 3. Ativan .5 mg twice a day . 4. Nasal oxygen 3L per minute . 5. Levaquin 500 mg per day to be continued until 4/12/99 . 6. Lasix 40 mg per day . 7. Prednisone 40 mg per day to be tapered over two weeks . 8. Xalatan eyedrops 1 gtt in left eye per day . 9. Alphagan 1 gtt in left eye three times a day . 10. Trusopt 1gtt in left eye three times a day . 11. Prilosec 20 mg per day . FOLLOWUP : The patient should have follow up with his primary care physician Dr. Rod Linkeboltshieltrus at the TRE 453 about one week after discharge from rehab facility . The telephone number at his office is 236-4518 . ROD END , M.D. TR : lh DD : 04/05/1999 TD : 04/05/1999 3:06 Pcc : ROD END , M.D. C.R.TRYGLO HOSPITAL OF STAT
